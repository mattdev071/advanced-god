#### **Memory Issues**
```
Error: CUDA out of memory
```
**Solution**: Reduce `micro_batch_size` or enable `gradient_checkpointing`.

#### **Low Scores**
**Solutions**:
1. Check performance reports for optimal configurations
2. Ensure you're accepting high-priority tasks (DPO/GRPO)
3. Verify H100 optimizations are enabled
4. Monitor learning rate effectiveness

### **Performance Optimization**

#### **For Better Scores**
1. **Focus on DPO/GRPO tasks** - highest scoring potential
2. **Accept large models** - leverage H100 advantage
3. **Monitor performance reports** - learn from successful jobs
4. **Use proven model families** - Llama, Qwen, Mistral, etc.

#### **For Higher Throughput**
1. **Optimize batch sizes** for your specific model sizes
